## Plugin Review
Group|Tool|Comments|Example
-----|----|--------|----------------------
Migration Justice  | Sleep | This would be really helpful if our map was centered in our website but since it isn't then I don't think we will use it as it require substantial revision of our page design. I would recomment it to those with bigger maps | N/A |
Against Asian Hate | Beautify Marker | Hoping to implement this for our final project, will check on other plugins if needed. | N/A 
Mental Health Group | 
SEA Admit Tours | Leaflet Sidebar V2 | The Sidebar V2 is the most practical mapplication for us because we are able to showcase personal stories while showcasing the campus of UCLA, where the personal interactions have happened. Everything is more condensed and streamlined, and the personal stories can have their own dedicated spaces along with the map.
Also allows people to see as much/little information as they want, and possibly allows easier navigation of the map for returning users 
Previously, we were thinking of having the map overlay with a random image of the location in which the story has taken place. This would not be feasible and would actually take away from the content and the spirit of the project. Instead, Sidebar V2 allows users to view both the story and the map as separate yet equally important entities that contribute to the overall goal, which is to allow Southeast Asian bruins to feel more connected to a Southeast Asian community. We thought that a plugin that would emphasize the user stories, rather than a plugin that would emphasize the markers on the map, which could detract from the focus on narratives that our map hoped to achieve.

Food Distribution Project | Leaflet Control Window | This is a very useful feature that we believe can allow us to better introduce our project goals and improve navigation for our users. It's really cool that you can modify the HTML within the window, making it easier to edit what's being displayed. We may add a button to our page that will allow users to revisit the popup if they would like to. | 
LA Tenants Survey |
Reimagining 6th Street | Leaflet Sleep | The first implementation has been wonky, we're trying to fix it! But we think this will be an extremely helpful tool in making sure our map stays fixed on the boundary of Koreatown. This tool will be applied in tandem with the button Albert suggested we implement at the bottom to zoom out to all submissions. | https://lvalles10.github.io/Transportation-Group/Reimagining_6th/index.html
