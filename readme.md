# Hello Welcome to the Git Practicing Repo
This repo was designed for practicing `git` commands for 21S-AsianAm191, expect things to ðŸ’¥!

Causing a git merge.

## Making a new branch:

```
git checkout -b helloNewBranch
```
This creates a branch called `helloNewBranch` and switches to it!

### `git add .` your changes to the new branch:
Make some changes and add them to the branch:
```
git add .
```

### Add a message to your commit
```
git commit -am "message"
```

### Push your changes to your new branch

This code creates a new branch called `helloNewBranch` on GitHub to push to:
```
git push --set-upstream origin helloNewBranch
```
You only need to run it when the branch DOES NOT exist on GitHub!!! After the branch is on GitHub, you can just to normal `git pushes`.
```
git push
```
